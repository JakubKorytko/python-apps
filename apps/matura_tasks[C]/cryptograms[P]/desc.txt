This application solves the described problem:

<Cryptograms>


1. Decrypt the cryptogram: LYRNAOHDCPUAS encrypted using the columnar method. The following was used here
a two-dimensional array containing 3 columns and the key: 2, 0, 1. Spaces were omitted during encryption

2. Write a program that decrypts any cryptogram using the column method with the ability to enter the number of
columns and the key. Skip spaces when encrypting.

3. Encrypt the text using the fence method: A QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG. Apply the fence
height 2. Skip spaces when encrypting.
