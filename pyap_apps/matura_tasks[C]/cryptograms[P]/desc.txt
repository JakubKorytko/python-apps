This application solves the described problem:

<Cryptograms>


1. Decrypt the cryptogram: LYRNAOHDCPUAS encrypted using the columnar transposition cipher. The following was used here
a two-dimensional array containing 3 columns and the key: 2, 0, 1. Spaces were omitted during encryption

2. Write a program that decrypts any cryptogram using the columnar transposition cipher
with the possibility to specify the number of columns and the key. Skip spaces when encrypting.

3. Encrypt the text using the rail fence cipher: A QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
Apply the fence height 2. Skip spaces when encrypting.
